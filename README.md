# Face Recognition Backend

This is the backend for a face recognition application. It uses the [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/) API to obtain the coordinates of any existing faces in the image.

The image is sent from the [frontend](https://github.com/richardeboehm/face_recognition_frontend) to the backend via a REST call, and the backend replies with the desired information.

The application was deployed using Heroku -- you can play around with it [here](https://face-recognition-frontend-rb.herokuapp.com/).
